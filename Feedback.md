Visual Stuff (all my opinions feel free to disregard lmao)
- I love the logo and the colors.
- I think the nav bar with the separate buttons looks a bit odd (maybe cause I'm not used to it). I think I prefer like the whole top being a sticky bar with the nav options being just words but ya know. Preferences lol
- The solid purple prototype things look a bit odd imo (phone and computer). Maybe an outline (either purple or pink but I think the pink would look cool) would be 

Project Info
- I don't think you need the dates on the front page
- I think it's a little odd that some (one) of your projects is on your site and the others are on medium. I think it makes it harder for people to browse when it links externally. At the very least, I'd make them all the same (all medium links or all on the site, leaning towards all on the site even though ik that's more work).
- More projects - I think having more info about it on the site would be good! These things also seem clickable (I tried clicking like 3 times and didn't notice the subtitle under more projects until I revisited it). Maybe just make them clickable (lol) and add some more photos and a short description. Or make the captions smaller so they seem less like titles/subheadings.

Next generation of ORCA
- On the page, I think you should switch the project part buttons (overview, research, etc) to pink. The purple is really light and it's difficult to read (contrast)
- For the Orca project page, You should make the google doc pages open in a new tab
- This is just my personal preference but I think making all those orca project things into pdfs rather than google docs just looks better imo (less busy) but that's probably just me lmao
- I think it'd be nice to have a little more info for the milestones that have a read more button (not sure if this is in the works!) Like a little synopsis or somethin
- If the paragraph at the top is supposed to be that, I think the organization is a bit odd as that looks more like the phase synopsis, and then you're missing the milestone synopsis (if that makes sense). I think ideally it'd be phase title, phase synopsis, milestone title, milestone timeline, milestone synopsis, milestone button, repeat milestone things until next phase. 
- I'm always for more visuals too! sketches (I personally digitized mine using illustrator pen tool so it wasn't as messy), photos (usability, analysis, etc.), wireframes, or hi fi mockups

Oh a couple more things
- I think when I click more projects at the bottom of your main projects I expect a dropdown/reveal of more, not navigating to more at the bottom of the page
- I like that you highlighted one project at the top! 
- I kinda want all of them to take up the same height so the desktop vs phone on the first line doesn't annoy me but like I wish it would be equal lmao
