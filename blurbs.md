Involved in the full iterative process from StayHome to WAnotify, working on a wide variety of different website and system designs in the process

StayHome was a mobile app developed in the first few months post COVID-19, starting before campus closed with informal student research, that supported people who want reliable information and resources, and who want to track symptoms and temperature, record COVID-19 testing and results, record exposures or travel, and identify their unique situations and risks. I built two sites, StayHome Resources and What is StayHome?, and worked extensively on the design of the application. This project evolved to become a part of CommonCircle.

The CommonCircle application was developed by faculty, staff developers, and students at the University of Washington (UW), in collaboration with volunteers from across Microsoft Research and Microsoft product divisions, and with oversight from the Washington Department of Health. CommonCircle is a pair of companion apps that seek to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community, specifically by helping people learn if they may have been exposed, connecting them to the appropriate public health guidance, and by enabling more efficient contact tracing. I built 4 different versions of the Common Circle project page, to reflect different iterations of the project including partnerships with the UW and Washington DOH. This project was one of the main elements that evolved to become a part of WAnotify.

WAnotify is a tool that works through smartphones, without sharing any personal information, to alert users if they may have been exposed to COVID-19. I have been involved in the iteration and refinement of the Exposure Notification Alert and the Exposure Notification Next Steps content given to people who have potentially been exposed to COVID-19. 


Completed multiple major websites (some examples below)

PROgress HIV Care: An in-depth site to distribute information on implementing patient reported outcomes within routine HIV care. This site includes a full implementation toolkit covering assessing clinic readiness and preparing for PRO implementation, stakeholder engagement strategies, building and/or selecting technical infrastructure for electronic data collection, creating a PRO assessment that best suits the needs of your clinic and its patients, including an online time-budget tool to minimize patient response burden and impact on clinic flow, PRO integration and sustainability success, staff training needs, and monitoring and evaluating successful PRO integration. PI: Rob J Fredericksen and Viiv Healthcare

HIV and Aging Research Consortium: This site is a tool for the HIV and Aging Research Consortium (HARC) to bring together experts from HIV and Geroscience to: identify mechanisms that lead to chronic disease, premature morbidity, functional decline and geriatric syndromes in PLWH (People living with HIV); discover markers of the aging process in PLWH; and explore interventions to prevent and slow premature aging in PLWH. PI: Lydia N Drumright

Rural Opioid Initiative: A site that consists of both public facing and password protected internal pages to facilitate and help address the opioid and injection drug use crisis in rural America. The project is funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), in partnership with the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). PI: Bridget M Whitney and Lydia N Drumright

GIFT Care for Elderly: An interactive site to distribute curriculum on appropriate behavioral modifications for elderly demented patients developed by St. Peter Family Medicine Residency and edited by Dr. Yue Teng for use in graduate medical education. PI: Yue Teng

In addition to smaller project sites with much quicker turn arounds (examples below) 

Take on Transplant: A site to introduce the Take on Transplant system and demonstrate its features and itâ€™s goal to help people living with CF explore stories from people living with cystic fibrosis (CF) as they share their experiences with lung transplant. PI: Dr. Kathleen Ramos

Computerized Patient-Reported Outcomes: This site is redesigned and updated to introduce stakeholders to the functions and past projects that cPRO, an open-source software for "computerized patient-reported outcomes", crafted and maintained by the UW Clinical Informatics Research Group, has been used for. PI: Justin McReynolds and Bill Lober
