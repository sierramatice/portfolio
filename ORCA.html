							<p>ORCA, Puget Sound’s inter-agency public transit system, has had a stagnant 60% adoption rate for years despite the best efforts of transit agencies. It has been demonstrated in other cities, namely London, that eliminating cash payment can increase the efficiency of public transit by up to 30%. For our project, we took on the challenge of reducing cash payment in Seattle, specifically for event attendees as a type of infrequent rider.
							<br><br>
							We began by performing user research and usability testing on the TransitGO mobile ticketing application. We identified some key functionality that users expect in a mobile transit service as well as came to the conclusion that mobile ticketing does not meet the needs of our users.
							<br><br>
							We identified next gen ORCA as the best reasonable solution and dedicated our project to designing the best mobile experience for ORCA users we could based on our research. ORCA pay, our final application, is designed to fit into the next gen ORCA system that is planned to be rolled out in 2021. Allowing users to instantly manage several ORCA accounts at once as well as use their phone as a credential to pay for train, light rail, bus, streetcar, and water taxi fare.
							<br><br>
							This is an brief overview of the process and the deliverables created for our 2019 HCDE capstone project. The project was a collaboration of our team and our sponsors, the CoMotion Mobility Innovation Center, King County Metro, Sound Transit, along with Challenge Seattle, the Seattle Department of Transportation and the Washington State Department of Transportation. Capstone team 20 (Infrequent Riders: Event Attendees) includes Ryan Zuzelski, Zoe Escalona, Zach Thomas and myself, Sierramatice Karras.</p>

							<p>My primary responsibilities included the application design and the interactive prototype as well as having a major hand in the planning and implementation phases of the research and evaluation stages of the project and the design work for the TransitGO recommendations. </p>

							<p>The goal we were given by our sponsors was to </p>

							<p class="major">reduce cash fare payments and increase a stagnant 60% ORCA adoption rate.</p>
 
							<p>We initially planned to approach this through a redesign of the existing TransitGO application, but the results of our research led us in a different direction.  </p>

									<h3>Mobility Innovation Center</h3>
									<p>The Mobility Innovation Center (MIC)  is sponsored by Challenge Seattle and the University of Washington to “tackle specific transportation challenges, using applied research and experimentation”. We were one of the teams that they set to “attack regional mobility problems, develop new technologies, apply system-level thinking, and bring new innovations to our regional transportation system”. Our main point of contact with the MIC was with Gaia Borgias, who helped coordinate the biweekly meetings between us and representatives of Sound Transit and King County Metro, as well coordinating as our mid-project and final presentations of to our sponsors.</p>

							<h2>Process</h2>
							<p> Our process had two major phases that were subdivided into the four main milestones (which themselves are subdivided). The first phase was our Research and Evaluation and the second was our Designs and Recommendations. Both phases and the elements they contain are detailed further on this page.</p><img src="images/process.png" class="image fit">

							<h2>Capstone Open House</h2>
							<p><img src="images/ORCA_present.jpg" class="image right">The final presentation we had of our project was at the 2019 HCDE Open House. This was a joint presentation of all the HCDE bachelors and masters capstone projects from the 2018-2018 academic year. For this presentation we created a poster and business cards with access to the interactive prototype and the promotion video as well as having a phone running the interactive prototype and a laptop running the promotional video for people to view. Additional things we did to bring in more context of our project was having small light rails on the table and wearing the King County Metro vests we were given to wear at the while conducting our on the ground interviews and usability studies. </p>
							<p><img src="images/people.jpg" class="image right">I spoke to many open house attendees and judges, giving an elevator pitch version of our process and deliverables, as well answering any questions. All of our efforts for our project and at the open house resulted our team winning the <b>people’s choice award.</b></p>
