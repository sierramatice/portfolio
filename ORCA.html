							<p id="overview">ORCA, Puget Sound’s inter-agency public transit system, has had a stagnant 60% adoption rate for years despite the best efforts of transit agencies. It has been demonstrated in other cities, namely London, that eliminating cash payment can increase the efficiency of public transit by up to 30%. For our project, we took on the challenge of reducing cash payment in Seattle, specifically for event attendees as a type of infrequent rider.
							<br><br>
							We began by performing user research and usability testing on the TransitGO mobile ticketing application. We identified some key functionality that users expect in a mobile transit service as well as came to the conclusion that mobile ticketing does not meet the needs of our users.
							<br><br>
							We identified next gen ORCA as the best reasonable solution and dedicated our project to designing the best mobile experience for ORCA users we could based on our research. ORCA pay, our final application, is designed to fit into the next gen ORCA system that is planned to be rolled out in 2021. Allowing users to instantly manage several ORCA accounts at once as well as use their phone as a credential to pay for train, light rail, bus, streetcar, and water taxi fare.
							<br><br>
							This is an brief overview of the process and the deliverables created for our 2019 HCDE capstone project. The project was a collaboration of our team and our sponsors, the CoMotion Mobility Innovation Center, King County Metro, Sound Transit, along with Challenge Seattle, the Seattle Department of Transportation and the Washington State Department of Transportation. Capstone team 20 (Infrequent Riders: Event Attendees) includes Ryan Zuzelski, Zoe Escalona, Zach Thomas and myself, Sierramatice Karras.</p>

							<p>My primary responsibilities included the application design and the interactive prototype as well as having a major hand in the planning and implementation phases of the research and evaluation stages of the project and the design work for the TransitGO recommendations. </p>

							<p>The goal we were given by our sponsors was to </p>

							<p class="major">reduce cash fare payments and increase a stagnant 60% ORCA adoption rate.</p>
 
							<p>We initially planned to approach this through a redesign of the existing TransitGO application, but the results of our research led us in a different direction.  </p>

							<h2>Process</h2>
							<p> Our process had two major phases that were subdivided into the four main milestones (which themselves are subdivided). The first phase was our Research and Evaluation and the second was our Designs and Recommendations. Both phases and the elements they contain are detailed further on this page.</p><img src="images/process.png" class="image fit">

							<h1 id="R+E">Research and Evaluation</h1>
							<p>Research and Evaluation were done simultaneously during our project. This was because we were evaluating the existing TransitGO application and researching the wants and needs of our user group. Milestone 1: Preparation and Milestone 2: Research and Evaluation both contributed to this phase of the project. Milestone 1 contained the initial research and tools we created to do the Research and Evaluation and Milestone 2 contained the findings of what we did. </p>
							<h2>Preparation</h2>
							<div class="items style1 big">
								<section>
									<h3>Field Observation</h3>
									<p>We conducted a single hour and a half long field observation session at the Stadium Light Rail stop at the end of a Mariners game. The purpose of this observation session was to learn about our user group and look for interesting phenomena to aid in the development of interview questions. My involvement in this stage was in the analysis and interpretation of the results of the observation session.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
									<p>In order to get a better idea of how transit applications work around the world we did competitive analysis of five applications. Each team member chose an application to analyze and two members of our team did a more in depth analysis of the local application in Tacoma. To the right are screenshots from the San Francisco transit app, Muni Mobile, the application I focused on. This stage helped us understand transit best practices, and by looking at application reviews we got a better idea of what people in general like from a transit payment application. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
									<p>We performed a heuristic evaluation of the Transit GO mobile ticketing app. Each heuristic was considered for six different sections of the app:  Trip Planner, Use, Store, More Info, Account, and Settings. We included screenshots of each section of the app we evaluated. For each heuristic on each section we either gave a pass or fail. For each fail we gave a description and rationale of our evaluation as well as a severity rating on the scale of 1-3. We performed this evaluation to get an idea of the issues that may cause difficulty for our users before we moved on to user research.  The pass or fail and the severity ratings helped us determine the biggest issues to focus on. Our findings helped us develop our evaluation criteria for the rest of our research. We all worked equally on this step of the project, dividing up the sections of the app so they could all receive the necessary attention. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Test Kits</h3>
									<p>In order to streamline our research and evaluation process, we created test kits that contained everything we would need to conduct the user interviews and usability tests. This included consent forms, note-taking forms, and planning dates and times to conduct the research and evaluation. This preparation was important for increasing the total number of interviews and usability tests we were able to do as well as keeping them consistent between participants and facilitators. I was heavily involved with the organization of the test kits but as a team, we all contributed equally to their creation. </p>
								</section>
							</div>
							<h2>Findings</h2>
							<div class="items style1 big">
								<section>
									<h3>User Interviews</h3>
									<p>We conducted 36 user interviews with event attendees to discover our target user group’s habits, pain points, and desires. Our participants were recruited in a guerilla style outside of Centurylink Stadium and T-mobile park before and after Sounders and Mariners games. The pictures to the right are of our note taking sheets from the test kit we created. This step was essential for learning more about how infrequent riders use public transportation and current payment methods, and the informal recruiting method that we used helped us get a broad sample of our user group. While outside the events we split into pairs of interviewers and notetakers. I frequently took the role of notetaker in my pair, but we alternated roles between interviews.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
									<p>Usability tests were conducted in a similar manner as the user interviews. We had 22 event attendees run through a series of key tasks on the Transit GO application. Halfway through the research phase we made an adjustment to the tasks participants were completing because we felt we had reached data saturation. These tests of the existing application helped us narrow down which elements we needed to focus on. 
									<br><br>I took the lead on the iOS usability tests as I was one of two team members with the test application installed on my phone. We worked to get permission for a second test application part way through this stage, because we recognized the need to have data about the differences between the android and iOS versions.
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Interview Analysis</h3>
									<p>This step of the project was focused on taking the data we collected from our user interviews. We were able to do numerical analysis on a number of the questions from the interview, as we categorized responses on our note taking sheet. We with the analysis we answered cross-cutting questions about our participants. Our interview questions explored many facets of the public transportation experience of event attendees, but we wanted the quantitative evidence and heightened clarity achieved through a formal interview data analysis. This gave us the ability to see trends in what event attendees thought about public transportation. I did much of the data analysis of for the interviews, and was assisted by the rest of my team in data entry and determining what comparisons would give us the most relevant information.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Affinity Diagramming</h3>
									<p>After entering all of the data we collected from our usability tests, we wrote it all out onto sticky notes in order to sort them to determine major pain points within the application. Additionally, we used this exercise to find overarching issues that encompassed a number of user pain points.
									<br><br>This was done as a team over the course of two meetings, resulting in two whiteboards full of sticky notes and a much better idea of what needed the most work in the TransitGO application.</p>

							<h1 id="Deliverables">Deliverables</h1>
							<p>We had three separate deliverables for our capstone project. The next two paragraphs will go into why we made the decision to go this route and what led to each of our deliverables. Each deliverable had their own development process that grew from the findings of our research and evaluation. While some elements, such as the Marketing Recommendations and Rewards and Incentives appear in and are tailored to one of the deliverables (TransitGO), they are broadly applicable.
							<br><br>Three main things pushed us to shift our focus to next gen ORCA. First, next gen ORCA provides more advantages over cash than TransitGO. Second, next gen ORCA provides more of the features that our research found users wanted and needed. And third, next gen ORCA will make TransitGO obsolete. These three points led us as a team to give quick fix design recommendations for TransitGO over an in-depth redesign and change our focus to designing a companion app for next gen ORCA.  
							<br><br>Once we had decided to work on next gen ORCA we needed to determine what kind of an application would best serve the wants and needs of the user that we found through our research. We eventually settled on a two app system, one payment app, and one utility app. We made this decision because of the many separate use cases of these functions, allowing non ORCA users to still access the utility functions necessary to navigate Seattle and to avoid the bloated hard to navigate application that many transportation agencies (including Seattle) have ended up with. We designed the payment application, that we named ORCApay, and for the utility application because it is already a well-established application with plans to expand to cover most of the utility functions that would be in a Puget Sound Transit Utility app, we decided to recommend a partnership with OneBusAway.</p>

									<h3>Mid Project Check-in @ CoMotion</h3>
									<p>On April 12th, at the beginning of spring quarter, all of the teams working with the Mobility Innovation Center at CoMotion met to present their progress to the other teams and sponsor representatives from the MIC, King County Metro, Sound Transit and Bytemark (the company who developed the TransitGO application). This was an opportunity to see how the other teams were working on their goals within Seattle transportation. It was also an opportunity to ask questions of and get feedback from a larger number of our sponsors than we we get to meet with on a regular basis.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Challenge Seattle Final Presentation</h3>
									<p>At the end of the quarter, our whole team went to present our final deliverables to our sponsors at Challenge Seattle. We, along with three other capstone teams, presented to Mamie Marcuss, the director of programs. This was a great opportunity to meet with an organization who can help promote our vision for next gen ORCA and encourage its development in the future.
									<br>It was also very interesting to see how the other teams' projects had developed since the meeting at the beginning of spring quarter. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>King County Metro Final Presentation</h3>
									<p>For this sponsor presentation, only Zach Thomas and I were available. We gave the same talk that we had given at the Challenge Seattle presentation, but divided between two of us rather than four and to a larger group. People from throughout King County Metro attended. 
									<br>This presentation gave us the opportunity to show our research findings and design recommendation to people more directly involved in the Seattle Transportation network. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Smashing Ideas Presentation</h3>
									<p>In October 2019 we presented to the UX firm that has been hired to develop the next gen ORCA digital system, Smashing Ideas. We met with them early in their design process to share and discuss our research findings and design recommendations. The intention of the meeting was for the team at Smashing Ideas to learn from and incorporate our work into their final system. </p>

							<h2>Capstone Open House</h2>
							<p><img src="images/ORCA_present.jpg" class="image right">The final presentation we had of our project was at the 2019 HCDE Open House. This was a joint presentation of all the HCDE bachelors and masters capstone projects from the 2018-2018 academic year. For this presentation we created a poster and business cards with access to the interactive prototype and the promotion video as well as having a phone running the interactive prototype and a laptop running the promotional video for people to view. Additional things we did to bring in more context of our project was having small light rails on the table and wearing the King County Metro vests we were given to wear at the while conducting our on the ground interviews and usability studies. </p>
							<p><img src="images/people.jpg" class="image right">I spoke to many open house attendees and judges, giving an elevator pitch version of our process and deliverables, as well answering any questions. All of our efforts for our project and at the open house resulted our team winning the <b>people’s choice award.</b></p>
